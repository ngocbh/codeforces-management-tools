Almost all functions of Conmato require a manager account logging in before performing.
Usually, Conmato will ask on each action. 
You can log in once and save the session for future uses by:

```sh
conmato login
```

For example, to get standings in a contest (e.x. `http://codeforces.com/group/Ir5CI6f3FD/contest/269185/standings/groupmates/true`), 
you have to pass `group_id` (e.x. `Ir5CI6f3FD`) and `contest_id` (e.x. `269185`)

```sh
conmato get standings -g Ir5CI6f3FD -c 269185
```
